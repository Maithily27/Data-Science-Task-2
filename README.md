# Data-Science-Task-2
In this project, I performed comprehensive data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The process included handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing inconsistencies to ensure high-quality data. I conducted EDA using statistical summaries and visualizations to uncover relationships between variables, such as passenger demographics, ticket classes, and survival rates. Key patterns and trends—like the impact of gender, age, and class on survival probability—were identified using bar plots, histograms, heatmaps, and correlation matrices. This analysis provided meaningful insights that could be used for predictive modeling.
